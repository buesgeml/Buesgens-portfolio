    <h1>ABOUT<br>ME</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Meghan Buesgens<br>
        and I am a Graphic Communications<br>
        major at UW-Eau Claire. I am currently in my third year of school here at UWEC, and I am completing a variety of art and design classes that contribute to the graduation requirements for my major. Some of these classes include Graphic Design, Painting, and Typography. I have a lot of passion and appreciation for physical art mediums, like painting and drawing, so most of the art I complete in my free time is of that nature, and I hope to one day be able to sell paintings and jewelry at markets, local stores, festivals, etc. Some of my skills include Adobe Softwares, visual design, painting, jewelry-making, and Spanish.</p>
