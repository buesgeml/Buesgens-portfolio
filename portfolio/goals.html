<h1>Academic and Artistic Progress and Goals</h1>
<p>I am currently in my third year of school here at UWEC, and I am completing a variety of art and design classes that contribute to the graduation requirements for my major. Some of these classes include Graphic Design, Painting, and Typography. I have a lot more passion for physical art mediums, like painting and drawing, so most of the art I complete in my free time is of that nature, and I hope to one day be able to sell paintings and jewelry at markets, local stores, festivals, etc. Some of my skills include Adobe Photoshop, jewelry-making, Spanish, and reciting the NATO phonetic alphabet.
