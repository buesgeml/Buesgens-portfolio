<h1>Work Experience</h1>
<p>My first job ever was a restaurant hostess at the Market Grille restaurant inside of Hy-Vee in Savage, MN. I worked there for about two years from 2018-2020 until the restaurant’s Covid-related closing. During the summer of 2021, I worked as an inventory clerk for a small software repair company in Eagan, MN called Unique Software. It was a great summer office job that helped me gain a lot of technological skills and experience, but it also helped me realize that I very much prefer the fast-paced environment of a restaurant when it comes to a part-time job. Now, when I am home in Minnesota for breaks, I serve at a restaurant called Harry’s Scratch Kitchen in Lakeville, MN. While at school here in Eau Claire, I work at an Italian restaurant called Mona Lisa’s, where I have worked as both a hostess and a server for a little over a year now.
